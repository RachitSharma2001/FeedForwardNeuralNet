# FeedForwardNeuralNet
A simple feed forward Neural Network made with TensorFlow.

In this Python program, I used Tensorflow to create a simple feedforward neural network that predicts from the MNIST flower data set the type of flower
based on certain features.

The input and output arrays are the data. I created a program to read the MNIST data and then output arrays containing that data, which I then put into my program.

Overall, this program takes only about 20 epochs before reaching around 98% accuracy.
